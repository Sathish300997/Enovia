Steps involved in vpc creation:
 
 
    1.  create a own VPC.
	
	2.create a public and private subnet for different available zone by assingning different CIDR blocks.
	
	3.create a internet gateway and attach it to vpc.
	
	4.create routing table one as public and one as private by associating the appropriate subnets to it.

    5.Edit the public route table, route alone and map the IGW, not the private and leave it as it is.

    6.create two security groups- one for public (Edit the inbound rules with RDP, HTTP/HTTPS,SSH and map 0.0.0.0/0 in the source) and one for private (Edit the inbound rules and map the sg of public in the source)

    7.create two EC2 one in public and one in private subnets with proper security groups.

    8. Login into public and check the internet connection.

    9.create a NAT gateway with new ElasticIP for the internet connection in the private subnet.map it to private RT.

    10. Now login into the private EC2 and verify the connectivity and internet facility.
